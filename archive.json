This is because sending packets to an non-validated address is an vector for amplification attacks. We can resolve the issue by sending the certificate chain along with the ESNIKey and using an encrypted variant of Cached Certificate Extension.\r\n\r\nWe also revive the possibility of doing 0-RTT using semi-static key, because the key will be signed by the certificate.\r\n\r\nI think that providing performance improvement might give people more incentive to start using ESNI.",

It is possible for the fronting server to communicate the true SNI to the hidden server, but at the cost of having that communication not be unmodified TLS 1.3. The basic idea is to have a shared key between the fronting server and the hidden server (this can be a symmetric key) and use it to send Z at the beginning of the connection before the ClientHello. The hidden server can then decrypt ESNI to recover the true SNI.\r\n\r\nAn obvious alternative here would be to have the fronting server forward the true SNI, but that would allow the fronting server to lie. In this design, the attacker would need to be able to find a Z which would expand into a key that would validly AEAD-encrypt a message of his choice, which should be intractable (Hand-waving alert!).\r\n~~~\r\nWhat I don't see is a mention that the network transmission between the fronting server and the hidden server  could be spied upon.

In that case fine, though it might be worth clarifying.\r\n\r\nThe other concern I had was risking of turning this into another OCSP (where network failure and attack basically look the same so clients end up ignoring both), but I guess that with DoH, DPRIVE and DNSSEC an attack here is much harder to pull off.

You can use an HTTP connect tunnel, traverse a CNAME (or 3), or engage in some alt-svc load balancing and, while these things all change the DNS name you lookup and connect() to, they don't change the SNI.\r\n\r\nwhat about eSNI? the keys are a property of the server, not really the origin. It seems really hard to coordinate this across administrative domains.\r\n\r\nThe case I'm particularly worried about is where more than one hosting provider is in the mix.. ISTM a typical way of doing this is LB'ing DNS responses with CNAMEs. (e.g. 50% of www.example.com gets CNAME www.cdnA.com and 50% gets www.cdnB.com).. We've got folks from 2 CDNs as active contributors here who know better than I, but this kind of level of indirection to get you CDN agility seems pretty common.. we would want cdnA and cdnB to be able to each use their own keys.\r\n\r\nEven without agility, its a pretty common pattern for an origin to maintain control of their own DNS and only delegate to a CDN under load/whatnot and do that via cname...\r\n\r\nthat argues to me to allow _esni TXT records on the server lookup, not just the origin name. Perhaps they could override the _esni at the origin scope but that seems like a way to trigger the misconfiguration fallback path.\r\n\r\nAlso, what about connect tunnels where you do do SNI, but don't traditionally do DNS at all?\r\n\r\n",

Please see my comment on https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-esni/issues/7#issuecomment-388531906.\r\n\r\nRegarding the multi-CDN use-case, I do not think there is a easy solution.\r\n\r\nOne way of supporting that kind of configuration will be to do the following:\r\n1. (instead of querying for A and _eni) client only queries for A. Let's consider example.com is queried for and 1.2.3.4 is returned.\r\n2. client then connects to the return address via https to obtain the ESNIKeys (i.e. https://1.2.3.4/.well-known/esni-keys/example.com\r\n3. client connects to 1.2.3.4 with ESNI specifying \"example.com\"\r\n\r\nBut this has more overhead, looks more like TLS tunneling...\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd prefer to not covering multi-CDN use-case.

Rather, I would argue that `_esni.a.example.com` should be used in that case, due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* some APIs used for querying a hostname (or a DNS record) might resolve CNAME's by itself\r\n  * `getaddrinfo` is one of such APIs, though it does not provide you the ability to query TXT records\r\n* we can fully parallelize the address resolution and the ESNI key resolution if we select `_esni.original-host` as the name\r\n\r\nIf we are _not_ going to use the original hostname, I wonder if we could use the final result rather than the intermediate result (e.g., assuming that a.example.com results to 192.0.2.1, query `_esni.1.2.0.192.in-addr.apa`). That solves the API issue and the multi-CDN use-case, with the downside being that the queries cannot be parallelized.",

In my view, what you can do is as follows:\r\n* construct encrypted_server_name extension\r\n* construct ClientHello, with passing in the ESNI extension and the key-exchange context that was used for constructing the extension as the arguments\r\n  * add the key-exchange context being passed in to ClientHello\r\n  * omit constructing a key-exchange context if the id of the context to-be-constructed matches that of the supplied context\r\n\r\nTo me, they seem to be fairly limited change.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I think the question of if we should have different key shares depends on if we want to apply different crypto to the ESNI and the TLS application payload. My preference is to use single crypto whenever possible for simplicity and in hope that we can reuse ESNIKeys for other purposes in the future.",

Current approach of ESNI changes the negotiation from client-offers-a-list-server-chooses-one, to server-offers-a-list-client-chooses-one.\r\n\r\nI think that it might be fine to revert to the TLS 1.3 way of negotiation. Actually we might be required to do that, if we want to prevent a client-facing server downgrading the crypto in the split server scenario.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I am not sure if we would want to use a _separate_ key share for ESNI, because that would require additional CPU cost. My benchmark tells me that in case of X25519, key generation takes about half the time of key derivation. That means that if we are going to have separate key shares but the algorithm collides, the client will be spending 17% more CPU cycles (i.e. 1 key generation + 2 derivations vs. 2 key generations and 2 derivations).\r\n\r\nConsidering the cost, I think that we'd be tempted to try reuse the key-share for two purposes (i.e. ESNI and TLS handshake), even if we define separate key exchange fields for the two.\r\n\r\nAnd that in turn make me wonder what the value is for having separate key exchange fields.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I do not oppose to allowing client send multiple key shares or allowing server send HRR when ESNI is involved, but I prefer using the value of the KeyShares extension for carrying the ECDH key being used to encrypt ESNI.",

The client will then send a KeyShare in that group, and you have been undetectably downgraded.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the attack works against servers that support ESNI. The server will fail to find the private key that matches the ESNIKeys being used by the client (based on the value of record_digest), and the handshake will fail (that is the defense we implemented in #24).\r\n\r\n> This works even against a non-ESNI servers.\r\n\r\nI think that this is true. One way to fix the issue will be to use the value of ESNIKeys as an input to the Key Schedule (see #66), but a fix like that will not work with unmodified hidden server in Split mode. \r\n\r\nHaving that said, I am not sure if this is kind of an attack we need to fix. An attacker that can tamper the DNS responses can mount a DoS attack in a simpler way: send a negative response to an A query. Our model of sending unauthenticated ESNIKeys over DNS is based on the perception that DoS or preventing ESNI from working is possible when unauthenticated transmission of DNS is involved, but that does not open _new_ attack vectors.\r\n\r\n> There's also a weaker attack in which the client-facing server just sends a weaker share in ESNIKeys. This will be very hard for the server to detect.\r\n\r\nThis is true. I think the question here is if we want to permit using different key-shares / cipher-suites for ESNI and application data. As you point out, it relates to #67.",

Googling also tells me that managed DNS services like Route 53 and Azure DNS provide the capability, although surprisingly they use different escape sequences ([Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html#TXTFormat) uses `\\` + 3 octal, [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/azure/dns/dns-faq) uses `\\` + 3 decimal).",

      "body": "I don't know that I can give out my advice here before, so I had written an e-mail to draft-rescorla-tls-esni@ietf.org and that's my first time to send an email to IETF. I don't know whether sending an e-mail is the right thing, so I would paste it here again.\r\n\r\nI'm not a native English speaker, I would apologize for my poor English first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### DNS record disadvantage\r\n\r\n#### 1.Impossible for wildcard A or AAAA record\r\n\r\nIt isn't possible for us to set a txt record for wildcard A or AAAA record (_esni.*.example.com. 60S IN TXT \"...\" \"...\"). \r\nThe same problem as https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-esni/issues/79 mentioned.\r\n\r\n#### 2.Publishing a public key using DNS is very inconvenient and insecure. \r\n\r\nIn general, we can't change the DNS record very conveniently (except some DNS which provide API), so that most domain owners won't change the key very often. \r\n\r\nAnd in some cases, domain owners host their site at host service providers (I don't know how to explain that in English. Host service provider use one physical or virtual server to host many sites) once the provider want to change the ESNI public key, all owners on this server need to change their txt record on time, which is very inconvenient and nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe lack of frequently changing public key and the lack of Perfect Forward Security only provide us little security.\r\n\r\n#### 3.DNS record limited only exist domains can enable ESNI\r\n\r\nAs DNS record is needed to be set, only the owner of a exist and valid domain can enable ESNI.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes we want to use encrypted-sni as a private entry. For example, I configured my server that client hello with the sni \"vps.panel\" would lead to the vps control panel ( I issued a cert for \"vps.panel\" from my own PKI ). Though I configured that the server must verify my identity using a client certificate, I don't want this private sni to be known to the public. But your draft's method won't allow this use case as \"vps.panel\" isn't a valid domain name, so that I won't be able to own this domain and set a DNS record for it.\r\n\r\n#### 4.Local DNS (hosts) won't work\r\n\r\nThe hosts file can only take the place of A and AAAA record and won't be able to set public key in hosts in the near future.\r\n\r\n#### 5.Requirements to the server is too high\r\n\r\nThis ESNI draft requires that the server can the decrypt the sni which is encrypted by any public key. This means that the server has to take hold all ESNI private keys. However, I think that it's not proper.  \r\nTo CDN service provider like Cloudflare, it means that one Cloudflare server has to storage all private ESNI keys of the websites hosted on it.  \r\nIn my opinion, the browser should encrypt the sni using all public keys found in the DNS record and add a few invalid ESNI along with those, to prevent the attacker identify the real sni from the number of public keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Purpose Enhancement - Wall-resistent\r\n\r\nIn some countries (e.g. China, North Korea, Iran) , people may want to use ESNI to break the government's GreatFireWall, which blocks people from visiting some website.\r\n\r\nThe wall isn't just a wall, but a very complicated system which can modify DNS resolve result ( DNSSEC isn't common ). They can simply block all _esni txt record, so that all browsers can' get the public key and downgrade to cleartext-sni.\r\n\r\nIf ESNI can be used with SNI Proxy, it would be a good solution to break the wall. However the DNS record limited only the owner can enable ESNI ( Another disadvantage of DNS :D )\r\n\r\n\r\n### My suggestions\r\n\r\nI think some ideas of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption/ is quite good. One good idea is to use a certificate to authenticate the Client-Facing Server instead of publishing a public key. My main idea is to introduce a series of HTTP headers like HSTS and HPKP. I will give an example below:\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would introduce these headers\r\n( These names may be not proper due to my poor English )\r\n\r\n```\r\nESNI:(preload);(includeSubdomains);max-age=??\r\nIf ESNI header presents in the response, it means this domain enables ESNI. Otherwise, the browser MUST ignore other ESNI-* headers.\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI:preload;includeSubdomains;max-age=31536000\r\n\r\nESNI-Resolve:{address};max-age=??\r\n{address} can be either FQDN or IP(s) the purpose is to hide the real domain during DNS resolve. The server MUST keep this header up-to-date. This header just like a cacheable CNAME record.\r\ne.g. \r\nESNI-Resolve: server233.domain-cdn.com;max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 0.0.0.0/16;max-age=2592000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 1.1.1.1;max-age=2592000\r\n\r\nESNI-Trust:{address or pin-hash};max-age=??\r\n{address} is the same as above. The only difference is that the FQDN can contain wildcard.\r\n{pin-hash} is similar to HPKP's pin-hash.\r\nCan have more than one this header in the HTTP Response. (Explain later)\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI-Trust:fqdn{ *.domain-cdn.com};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:ip{0.0.0.0/16};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:pin-hash{X523zEOQCuEJeU6PzewOGkKCRX+YLvfAsCYJbQubCuE=};max-age=31536000\r\n\r\n\r\nESNI-Policy:{policy};max-age=??\r\n{policy} can be \"force-encrypted-sni\", \"retry-clear-sni\", \"allow-dns-re-resolve\", \"disallow-dns-re-resolve\" defines the action if error happens using ESNI. \r\nCan have more than one this header in the Response. (Explain below)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have more than one header with the same name, but we may construct these in to a structure and encode (e.g.base64) into one header. The header may be very big, but don't worry, only the first response contains it, HTTP2 will automatically compress them into a few bits in the later response.\r\n\r\nWhen the first time I visit https://www.example.com , I just do the normal tls1.3 hand shake with clear-text sni. The server just do what it should do, but the response MUST contain those ESNI headers if ESNI is enabled. The browser MUST remember these headers ( unless in incognito mode )\r\n\r\nWhen the second time I visit https://www.example.com , the browser SHOULD NOT query DNS resolve for www.example.com, instead, it should visit the FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Resolve header. And the browser MUST NOT send clear-text sni in the ClientHello, instead, send a CH without sni or a special CH indicates using ESNI.  The Client-Facing Server  send back certificate, the browser validates the certificate and makes sure the certificate contains at least one FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Trust header. If mismatch, check the ESNI-Policy and determine whether to retry or not. \r\nAnd then re-handshake with the server with encrypted-ClientHello in the 0RTT data or another CH extension. \r\n( similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method )\r\n\r\nMy suggestions' advantages and disadvantages are nearly the same as draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method. It provides PFS, don't need to change the Split-Mode Server and solved some part of DNS sniffing. But the disadvantage is obvious too, the first hand shake can't be encrypted and the ESNI-Resolve may become incorrect over time. It needs to handshake twice, however, it provided PFS and I think it worth it. And if multiple sites are hosted on the same server (e.g.CDN, Host Service Provider), we just need to do the second handshake, which eliminate the risk of DoS attack in some level.... And I think 0RTT symmetric decryption is better than asymmetric decryption.\r\nSetting max-age too big or too small both have some risks, and I don't know how to solve it.\r\n\r\n**If you don't like the idea of authenticating the Client-Facing Server, you can simply replace the ESNI-Trust header's content into a public key and use your method. But I don' think set a static public key is a good idea ( explained in some part of DNS disadvantage ).**\r\n\r\nAll in all, we can't have both efficiency, performance and security,  reliability. You should make up your mind and choose whether to provide perfect security or perfect performance. I prefer the former.\r\n\r\nI know that my idea is similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption than yours. However, you are the candidate for TLS WG, so I hope you can think it over. But I do agree with your idea that \"no need to don't stick out\" or simply \"we can stick out\" :D",

I think we should revisit that.\r\n\r\nMy primary concern is that using 2 different names for the addressing and key information makes DNS aliasing un-necessarily complicated.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where www.example.com is a customer of bigHoster.com and bigHoster.com is deploying ESNI for all its customers.\r\n\r\nA classic way to do this is to have www.example.com be a CNAME for host1.bighoster.com\r\n\r\nunfortunately to use bighoster.com's new ESNI infrastructure www.example.com would need to add a CNAME record for _esni.www.example.com as well. So the ESNI deployment requires DNS changes outside of the org deploying ESNI, which is going to limit its deployment, which in turn is going to limit the breadth of its anonymity pool. :(\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've been told that anecdotally putting names under a CNAME is legal but error prone. RFC 1912 seems to have some language that suggests its not even legal (though that is informational).\r\n\r\nIf the ESNI information were instead stored without a prefix then the alias would automatically apply as the CNAME applies to all the RR's of a hostname.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for choosing the prefix was to avoid collisions in the TXT space, so it makes sense to also reopen #40 and use a non TXT RR type if we drop the prefix. I think the consensus is moving towards that being fine.\r\n\r\nThis would also resolve #79 to harmonize esni with existing dns deployments.\r\n\r\n",

Because a wildcard will much all names with the designated type, including the `_esni` prefix.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following configuration will support ESNI for all the hostnames under example.com, like `a.example.com`, `b.c.example.com`, because any query for `_esni.*.example.com` resolves to `*.example.com`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1\r\n*.example.com IN ESNI ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the only downside is that using prefix and a dedicated RR type at the same time might look strange. But it's practical.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we would prefer to require alias resolution for every ESNI client.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise, it's about reimplementing what DNS recursor usually does in the stub resolver. You need to do things like detecting too many redirects and/or loops.\r\n\r\nThere would also be a performance degradation, because each client needs to do the recursive lookup, while with the prefix we can rely on the recursive resolvers to do it and cache it for other clients.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, I wonder if there is any *practical* reason to reinvent the wheel.",

See section 2.3 of 7838\r\n```\r\n Note that the SNI information provided in TLS by the client will be\r\n   that of the origin, not the alternative (as will the Host HTTP header\r\n   field value).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe alternate is essentially just a cname for the origin. If host b is an alternate for origin a, in order to use the alternate you look up the DNS a/aaaa of b, do a TCP connect to b, and then use sni=a and expect a certificate valid for a. (indeed the point of the SNI is to tell the server what certificate you expect to see)\r\n\r\nWith esni you would continue to do all of those things, except of course sni=encrypted(a).. and the question becomes where do you find the key used for the encryption. Is it the ESNI DNS record of a (the origin) or b (the alternate host). That's the question the text is trying to resolve - it says to use a (the origin).

Thus, even with SNI encryption, an attacker which can enumerate the set of ESNI-enabled domains supported by a client-facing server can guess the correct SNI with probability at least 1/K, where K is the size of this ESNI-enabled server anonymity set. This probability may be increased via traffic analysis or other mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI think this is too restrictive. If I have 100000 names and 100 IPs and for all queries I randomly return four out of my 100 IPs chosen randomly, I still provide the same anonymity set but I violate the SHOULD. How about: `Content providers operating in Split Mode SHOULD ensure that the A and AAAA records for ESNI-enabled server names do not allow identifying the server name from the IP address. This can for example be achieved by always returning the same records for all ESNI-enabled names, or by having the function that picks addresses from a pool not depend on the server name.

They can even do this gradually over a large pool of servers, thus having some servers with different (or no) ESNI support during each careful rollout of ESNI software upgrades.\r\n\r\nIn practice the following conventions would be used:\r\n\r\n1. Any ESNI server IP must have exactly one PTR record (typically pointing to the hoster domain, such as a typical systematic CDN node DNS name).  Lets call this name ptrnam.dom\r\n\r\n2. The ESNI records would be under _esni.ptrnam.dom\r\n\r\n3. As with most PTR records ptrnam.dom is expected to have exactly one AAAA or A record pointing back at the same IP (if the starting IP is IPv6 only AAAA need to satisfy this, if IPv4 only A, the same ptrnam.dom can be used for one IPv4 and one IPv6 address if the ESNI records would be the same).\r\n\r\n4.

Large client-facing servers such as CDNs and shared IP hosters can deploy ESNI without having to negotiate DNS changes with all their customers (in fact with any of their customers).\r\n\r\n- B2. Operators of large pools of client-facing servers such as CDNs can roll out ESNI support and ESNI implementation upgrades in a piecemeal and controlled manner similar to how other system updates are rolled out.  Simply because each IP address will have its own ESNI records.\r\n\r\n- B3. ESNI key rotation becomes much simpler as there is no need to synchronize it between different servers in a pool (except where a pure layer 1/2/3 load balancer shares a single IP among multiple physical/virtual servers, such as the layer 2 HALinux scheme).\r\n\r\n- B4. ESNI private key protection can be much stronger when it is not shared among all the servers.  The private key may be kept in protected hardware and/or in volatile RAM.  The latter case would require clients to fall back to a different A or AAAA record until the DNS entries for now forgotten keys to have expired, but only in case of a server crash or similar event.\r\n\r\n- B5. Client queries for ESNI records do not reveal the actual query domain that will be encrypted, only the IP address to which the ESNI extension will be sent.\r\n\r\n- B6. The whole discussion about _esni prefix or no _esni prefix becomes a lot simpler when there is no need to put ESNI records in every end query domain, only domains of the client-facing servers, allowing to keep the unprefixed TXT name space clean for existing uses such as SPF.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n\r\n- P1: Clients will have to postpone the _esni DNS query until after receiving the answer to the A or AAAA query, thus adding an extra DNS roundtrip before the first connection to a name.  The usual DNS caching hierarchy should mitigate this.  In particular for popular CDNs, a client will typically use the same handful of IPs for lots of unrelated traffic, thus getting the ESNI records in its local cache.\r\n\r\n- P2: VM hosting/Physical hosting/connectivity providers not granting PTR name assignment control to IP address customers will cause the same problems as for other protocols (such as mail) and should thus be under the same or greater pressure to add that service.  However since the greatest ESNI benefit is with IPs shared among many unrelated domains, and the operators of such IPs typically have full IP space ownership or the leverage to get PTR records where normal customers cannnot, the effect on ESNI deployment should be limited.\r\n\r\n- P3: This may or may not make it easier to do spoofing attacks, as an MitM attacker can spoof DNS responses either for the A/AAAA records of a target query domain (pointing to servers entirely under the attackers control, including legitimate ESNI records for that server) OR spoof the ESNI records of a server address for which the attacker has obtained traffic intercept ability.  However these can be secured with the same DNS countermeasures already applicable to those DNS domains.\r\n\r\n- P4: query domains wishing to remain available in massively blocking markets (the kind that would not hesitate to block an entire CDN to stop access to a single web page) may have more difficulty opting out of ESNI so such blocking filters can recognize them as a permitted service.\r\n",

The key part is making ESNI a server property rather than an origin property, bypassing most of the issues with configuring each of the non-controversial origin domains that are just used as cover traffic.  Hard part is finding a hello content that doesn't stick out by using any values specific to using a controversial domain.  Per origin ESNI would stick out as most origins would feel pressured to not actively join the pool, while having to do something difficult or even pricey to stay out of the pool would be less easy to encourage via generic mass pressure.\r\n\r\nFor the following approaches compare to a normal first TLS connection:\r\n  Round 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\n  Round 2: TCP SYN\r\n  Round 3: TLS Handshake round 1\r\n\r\nWith the PTR based approach the parallelizing would go like this for first contact (later contacts benefit from DNS caching):\r\n\r\nRound 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\nRound 2: TCP SYN, DNS query for PTR and DNS query for ESNI keys directly in i*.arpa\r\nRound 3: DNS query for ESNI keys at PTR name (perhaps cached at nearby resolver).\r\n    This round is done only if\r\n     A: no ESNI record (not even an empty one) returned in round 2 AND\r\n     B: PTR name returned and contains the substring \"esni.\"  For example \r\n          example x1234.cdn.esni.example.net or x1234esni.example.net would cause queries of\r\n          _esni.example x1234.cdn.esni.example.net or _esni.x1234esni.example.net\r\nRound 4: TLS Handshake round 1\r\n\r\nRule 3 B would require ESNI client facing servers without ability to add arbitrary reverse records to at least be able to choose a PTR name of the magic form.  Note that the magic form contains no underscore but will only cost an extra DNS lookup returning NXDOMAIN if a non-ESNI server has that name form by chance.  The rule may require further refinement to deal with common provider practices.\r\n\r\nOne technique requiring less round trips than a full HTTP REST API would be to use a clever sequence of TLS extensions, signalling suites etc. to do everything in the TLS layer at the cost of extra TCP round trips compared to the current draft.\r\n\r\nA hybrid approach could go like this (first contact):\r\n\r\n  Round 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\n  Round 2: TCP SYN, DNS query for _esni.$reverseip.arpa\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with \"no\" record:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with the signalling suite and normal SNI, server responds normally\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with key:\r\n   Round 3: TLS hello with ESNI as per draft-02\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with \"ask\" record:\r\n   Round 3: TCP hello with invalid right-size data in ESNI extension, server sends keys in encrypted ESNI response.\r\n   Round 4: Send new hello with real ESNI extension inside encrypted stream, server forwards to origin server, once encrypted by origin server, client-side server drops the outer encryption and forwards remaining packets unchanged.\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is actually ESNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server sends keys in encrypted ESNI response.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n  Round 4: Send new hello with real ESNI extension inside encrypted stream, server forwards to origin server, once encryption activated by origin server, client-side server drops the outer encryption and forwards remaining packets unchanged.\r\n (Second TCP connection may be used or closed)\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is not ESNI and has a default certificate matching desired SNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server server responds normally using its default certificate, client uses the connection.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n (Second TCP connection may be used or closed)\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is not ESNI and has a default certificate not matching desired SNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server server responds normally using its default certificate, client aborts.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n  Round 4: TLS Hello with the signalling suite and normal SNI, server responds normally.

Looking forward a few decades, there is little or no assurance that SHA-256 won't be in a similar situation.  In contrast the error detection abilities of CRC-32 (the only purpose it has in this place) has been proven mathematically, has survived for much much longer and is much faster to run before deciding if the cryptographic calculations are needed at all.

Everyone works hard to remove SHA-256 from their cryptographic applications, or at least establish onerous review procedures to ensure any remaining SHA-256 invocation is not a security problem.\r\n\r\n3. ESNI using SHA-256 for a non-cryptographic purpose will then become a very real practical liability, as every implementation will need to make excuses and audit documents just to prove they are not really using SHA-256 for anything risky.\r\n\r\nIf in contrast, ESNI used something non-cryptographic, like CRC-32 or the TCP checksum algorithm, this step 3 of the problem wouldn't happen.  Of the commonly implemented short checksums, CRC-32 is the only one optimized for detecting accidental data corruption, while the other are optimized for tiny speed margins at the cost of less effective detection.\r\n\r\nAs for CRC-32 being available in ESNI implementations, this is likely to be present already because it is used in gzip HTTP compression, but standard CRC-32 may be available for many other reasons.

However the server MAY obscure any structure in the numbering in any convenient manner.  As a further optimization, move all fixed length fields before the variable length fields and order them such that natural alignment is achieved (as per IETF tradition).\r\n\r\n2. In ClientEncryptedSNI, insert the 32 bit id right after the Ciphersuite, making it part of the fixed-length part of the structure.  The record_digest field and its calculation is removed, thus reducing the size of the ESNI extension.\r\n\r\n3. In ESNIContents, just use the full record instead of hashing it separately.  This costs a few extra blocks of hash invocations (as the cache record_digest can no longer be cached for each hash algorithm), but simplifies the code.  Alternatively, record_digest can be kept for this non-transmitted field to preserve that caching opportunity.",

This avoids this odd situation we have here where ESNI wants to be the root of the tree, to the exclusion of everyone else who may wish to correlate data with A/AAAA.\r\n\r\nA nuisance here: we do want to avoid the client having to ask for all of A, AAAA, ESNI, *and* BUNDLE. It is more risk of performance problems and acting on any response to ESNI would reintroduce multi-CDN woes. We'd have to say ESNI can only be fetched via BUNDLE or so.

      "body": "The draft has provisions for GREASE ESNI extensions, per \"Do not stick out\". However, this is not very effective if an attacker can distinguish a GREASE ESNI extension from a real one.\r\n\r\n#154 tried to address this, but it doesn't work if the (public) ESNI record is known. There's also a simpler attack: replay the ClientHello with one byte of ciphertext corrupted. ESNI currently distinguishes key mismatch from decrypt failure, with the latter resulting in an alert. We can fix that by saying decrypt failure should behave like key mismatch. This still leaves record_digest.\r\n\r\nThe natural fix is to drop record_digest in favor of trial decryption. The cost is the server must perform a DH operation per known key. The number of keys the server needs depends on its DNS TTLs and key rotation. (I think it's 1 + ceil(dns_ttl / time_between_rotation), plus some leeway[*].)\r\n\r\nInstead, we can keep a key name, but make the space dense. Suppose we replace it with a B-bit \"key phase\". The server picks a random starting key phase. Then, each time it rotates the keys, it increments the phase, with wraparound. The server then gets 2<sup>B</sup> keys for free. If it needs more, it still needs trial decryption but gains a 2<sup>B</sup> multiplicative factor in the cost. On the flip side, an individual GREASE extension with a random key phase has a 1/2<sup>B</sup> chance of colliding with a particular ESNI key.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we actually need that many live keys, so B = 2 is probably plenty. Or even B = 1 if we say you should just rotate slower than your DNS TTL.\r\n\r\n[*] Note the robustness mechanism means that server doesn't need to cover _all_ clients with stale keys. The retry is expensive, so the server still needs to cover _almost all_ of them, but it can cut off the long tail.",

First, it's public information whether a given server supports ECHO, so if an attacker wants to know that, it can mostly just ask [there is some complexity around getting candidate names, but note that you can always get the public name from the SNI value and any real attacker will see a lot of non-ECHO traffic and so will know a bunch of SNI values].\r\n\r\nWhat's not public information is whether a given *connection* uses ECHO. The attacker might not know this either because:\r\n\r\n1. It knows that the server is ECHO-supporting.\r\n1. It has a limited view of just the connection and isn't willing to do do the work of trying to determine if the server is ECHO-supporting.\r\n\r\nIn case (1) I would also expect that the attacker is not going to go to the trouble of doing probe connections, as determining if the server is ECHO supporting is easier. This leaves us with the case where the attacker knows that the server is ECHO supporting and that the client *knows* about ECHO (otherwise it couldn't generate GREASE) but doesn't know if the client is actually doing ECHO. Do we expect there to be a lot of clients like this? Why not just do ECHO?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We definitely want to use DNSSEC to sign the record pointing from hidden to public.

At a minimum, if we expect the hidden servers to use CNAME, we should explain how to use DNSSEC to secure that.\r\n\r\nApart from DNSSEC, the other feature that we want is the support for multiple public servers, in case one of them is blocked. I don't think that CNAME can do that. In practice, the simplest way will be to have multiple ESNI records listed directly in the context of the hidden server.

The issue as written isn't crisp :-) What we require, among possibly other things that I didn't write down, is that the information and authentication context for a ticket is indistinguishable across all tickets possible for a given set of servers. So in the example you describe, if a client gets a ticket without authenticating from one server and then resumes it to a different server that normally would require authentication, then the ticket must record whether authentication took place. And storing that bit should not reveal information about the name.\r\n\r\n(I was just aiming to make a note of this so I didn't forget it later. There's probably other things to consider, too. I don't claim this is complete as written!)\r\n\r\n> Is the motivation is various attacks around seeing if the server accepts a ticket in various contexts? \r\n\r\nYep! This is a \"flip table\" solution to the problem that some server operators may wish to do. ",

There is a minor efficiency benefit in terms of the number of octets published in the DNS, but there is a lot of additional complexity in terms of code, and if nobody really publishes multiple public keys in one RR value, then that code is likely where we'll find CVEs. Reducing down to one public key per RR value also reduces the complexity when writing code to create/publish RRs.\r\n\r\nI think we have to support multiple RR values, because that's how the DNS works, and so the one to drop is the multiple public keys in one ECHOConfigs.

There are multiple ECHOConfig values in a single ECHOConfigs, which came from https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/pull/200. (Gosh, that was a terrible name. My bad. Maybe we should rename it?) I think the rationale there still holds? The problem is that an HTTPSSVC RR implies transport-level decisions, while not every ECHOConfig can be consumed by your TLS logic. Folding them together means transport connect needs to be aware of the exact ECHO capabilities. For instance, the origin could advertise:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo=ECHOv1\r\n* route2.example.com echo=ECHOv2\r\n\r\nThe logic picking HTTPSSVC routes no longer gets a free choice. It must be aware of the TLS layer's capabilities (down to mandatory extensions and HPKE code points). ECHOConfigs means the expectation is:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo={ECHOv1,ECHOv2}\r\n* route2.example.com echo={ECHOv2,ECHOv2}\r\n\r\nNow you pick a route freely and pass the entire opaque ECHO blob to TLS to interpret. Of course, one could still advertise:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo={ECHOv1}\r\n* route2.example.com echo={ECHOv2}\r\n\r\nBut you're no longer forced to explode it out like that, so we can say an ECHOv1-only client that happens to pick route2 can act as if route1 didn't exist. I.e. we set an expectation that all your routes must be equally capable. (Just as we have that expectation elsewhere. If route1 only speaks TLS 1.0, you're not getting TLS's downgrade protection because the attacker can always redirect you to the less secure config.)",

It seems (at least with OpenSSL) that once the cryptographic parameters (e.g. key shares) are allowed to vary between inner and outer, then things get significantly more complex. (That's not only down to\r\nthe trial decryption on the client btw, but is clearly demonstrated by the need for trial decryption.)\r\n\r\nI suggest we consider, for now, restricting how the inner and outer can vary, for example, only requiring implementations be able to handle minimal variation, perhaps only with server name and alpn and the nonce and ECHO that have to differ.\r\n\r\nIf, having coded this up, people figure it is actually  easy enough to support more flexibility then we could change to require support for that later.

This parameter is advantageous because it improves the efficiency of the solution by avoiding the server having to do trial decryptions. However, in some scenarios the configuration digest could leak privacy information. In version 7 of the ID, section 10.2 on \u201cClient Tracking\u201d describes one scenario, but there are others. A more complete and general discussion of the risks and mitigations would be useful.\r\n\r\nIf a particular domain has a unique public key then the configuration digest becomes a fingerprint for that domain. An attacker that has a list of such domains that they want to monitor can build a dictionary of the corresponding digests use this to identify traffic to the domains on their list.\r\n\r\nSome mitigations could be:\r\n1)\tAvoid the use of configuration digest\r\n2)\tOnly deploy in a mode where many domains share the same public key to make finger-printing too general to be useful\r\n3)\tTo change keys faster than attackers can update their list of fingerprints\r\n",

Compare ClientEncryptedCH.record_digest against cryptographic hashes of known ECHConfig and choose the one that matches.\r\n2. Use trial decryption of ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch with known ECHConfig and choose the one that succeeds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd later, we have guidance on what the server should do if decryption fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf decryption fails, the server MUST abort the connection with a \"decrypt_error\" alert.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis guidance makes sense to me for a server that is using record_digest matching to select an ECHConfig. If decryption fails using the matching record_digest, we must abort. However, I think it could be more clear for the trial decryption case, which is expected to have failed decryption attempt(s). \r\n\r\nI think something like this could be more clear:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf record_digest matching is used and decryption fails using the matching ECHConfig, the server MUST abort the connection with a \"decrypt_error\" alert.\r\n```\r\n",

Namely, for trial decryption, we say that the record_digest does not \"match\" the ClientHello if there's no key which successfully decrypts the ClientHello.

A \"match\" in the trial decryption case therefore implies that a key successfully decrypts the ClientHello, so the text referenced (\"If decryption fails...\") does not apply. ",

One might argue that the probability is higher than that because there could be more issues with carrying large TXT records than carrying A records. One might argue that the probability is below 2x because the two records are transmitted through the same path.\r\n\r\nAnyways, these arguments are about the quantitative difference about the probability.\r\n\r\nI prefer having a qualitative guarantee, that assures that there would be no increase in the probability of service disruption assuming that the owner of the `_esni` record does not misconfigure the service.\r\n\r\nHaving a checksum and validity period fields that can be validated by the client provides such guarantee.\r\n\r\nChecksum provides protection against accidental corruption.\r\n\r\nValidity period provides protection against misconfiguration or bugs in the DNS servers. It acts as a protection against an outdated ESNIKeys sent by an out-of-sync authoritative server or a buggy resolver causing disruption.\r\n\r\nThe downside of having checksum and validity is that the additional payload (currently 20 bytes, I think we can minimize this to 10 bytes by removing `not_before` (it's not that needed) and changing the type of `not_after` from `uint64` to `uint48`), and that the client would be required to do the validation.\r\n\r\nBut I assume that having qualitative guarantee that the probability of service disruption remains the same is worth the effort.\r\n\r\nCloses #20.",

Let me explain why I think sending cipher-suites list in ESNIKeys is not fine.\r\n\r\n@ekr Traditionally, we have allowed different cipher-suites to be selected depending on the value of SNI. This becomes an even more important property in the ESNI proposal, because we split the server into fronting server and hidden server. Cipher-suite selection is a negotiation between the client and the hidden server, whereas the ESNIKeys is a key-exchange between the client and the fronting server.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot / should not use ESNIKeys as a conveyer of cipher-suite negotiation.\r\n\r\nConsidering that we have disagreement on the how we can uses hashes, maybe it is a good idea to merge this as-is to fix the security hole, and get back to do the improvements later on if necessary.

Key generators do not need to care about uniqueness. TLS servers can just look for the matching digest and that's it.\r\n\r\nNote that a server operator can still associate an identifier to the ESNIKeys structure for internal use. The private key will be kept in relation to the structure anyways. So having a private identifier does not complicate things at all.",

Otherwise, CDNs cannot starting ESNI for any domains until all their customers permit the use ESNI.\r\n\r\nI think this should be possible with either approach.\r\nIn the non-prefixed case, the CDN can offer a dedicated CNAME target that has both the A/AAAA records of the ESNI enabled TLS servers and the ESNI records to use with them. If the customer doesn't want ESNI enabled, they can use the non-ESNI CNAME target. Or for CDN providers that offer a CNAME target personalized to the customer, this could be handled by a configuration at the CDN provider level.\r\nIn the prefixed case, it's of course a matter of the customer adding an _esni CNAME record pointing to the CDN's ESNI record.",

      "body": "(WG email coming shortly.)\r\n\r\nCloses #82.\r\n\r\nESNI has different compatibility characteristics than most TLS\r\nextensions. It involves client state, and encrypting the SNI makes the\r\nClientHello unusable for servers that do not have the key or do not\r\nimplement ESNI. This breaks common rollout and rollback strategies and\r\nplaces strong requirements on DNS/server consistency. This makes\r\ndeploying ESNI risky for servers.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to reduce these deployment risks. ESNI is much more\r\nuseful if widely deployed. Moreover, if ESNI is unreliable due to\r\ncomplex requirements on the server, clients will be disincentivized to\r\nimplement it. The DNS/server consistency requirements also\r\ndisincentivize rotating keys (section 7.2.5).\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the notion of a \"public name\" which allows the\r\nclient to receive authenticated signals from the server that the\r\nESNIKeys are out of sync, so clients can safely repair key mismatches.\r\nIt also aligns with existing server behavior before ESNI, so partial\r\nrollouts and rollbacks can also be handled.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the latter also handles MITM scenarios, replacing the\r\nexisting client recommendation:\r\n\r\n>   A Web client client can securely detect case (2) because it will\r\n>   result in a connection which has an invalid identity (most likely)\r\n>   but which is signed by a certificate which does not chain to a\r\n>   publicly known trust anchor.  The client can detect this case and\r\n>   disable ESNI while in that network configuration.\r\n>\r\n>   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-02#section-6.2\r\n\r\nThe public name notion fixes a bug in that text: an attacker could\r\ndisable ESNI on all servers, given the existence of *any* such server.",

Server ACK'd ESNI and did full handshake\r\n2. Server ACK'd ESNI and resumed PSK\r\n3. Server ignored ESNI (thus used SNI) and did full handshake\r\n4. Server ignored ESNI (thus used SNI) and resumed PSK\r\n\r\nIn particular, whether the server ACKs or ignores ESNI determines which name the server believes it is acting on behalf of. So we want that to be consistent with the identity the client has associated with the PSK, if any. (1) and (3) are vacuously self-consistent, so that's easy.\r\n\r\nAs for (2) and (4), presumably the client would not be offering a session good for the public name because it's actually trying to connect to the ESNI name. Thus we want to reject (4) and allow (2). (If we allow (4), then the verify-public-name section needs to decide whether this weird scenario counts as authenticating the replacement ESNI keys and that's weird.) That means the server needs to know not the produce (4).\r\n\r\nNow, we could that, if a server ignores the ESNI extension due to key mismatch, it should also ignore the PSK extension. That works, except:\r\n* We want to be robust to server rollbacks and partial deployments. Such a server won't know to ignore the PSK extension.\r\n* Being able to send GREASE extensions is nice and a GREASE client wants to accept (4) since all the names are actually identical all around.\r\n\r\nOur thinking was to instead take leaf out of EMS's (and new TLS versions in general) book and partitions the connection/resumption space by whether ESNI was used. We remember a bit in the session state for whether ESNI was used when establishing it. We then say that a client offering ESNI [for real, not GREASE] can only offer ESNI-ful sessions, and a server can only accept ESNI-ful sessions in ESNI-ful handshakes.\r\n\r\nThis gives all the properties we want:\r\n* Clients offering ESNI will only offer an ESNI-ful session, which is invalid for the server to accept if it declined ESNI. Thus it can reject (4) above.\r\n* This can work with ESNI-oblivious servers on rollback. The server makes the ESNI bit in the session state unparseable by older versions of itself. This is the same sort of thing the server would already have had to do for EMS, or TLS 1.3.\r\n* Clients offering GREASE ESNI will almost always offer ESNI-less sessions (last time I talked to the server, it presumably didn't have ESNI either). The server will decline ESNI (since it's random noise), which means it's allowed to resume ESNI-less sessions.\r\n\r\nThere isn't an immediate need to constrain ESNI-less sessions, so I didn't in this version of the text. Though maybe a full partition is cleaner? It also occurs to me I have no idea what to do about external PSKs. We could say that if you really want ESNI + external PSK (strange considering that ESNI is usually about picking a certificate anyway...), you have to associate an ESNI bit with the EPSK?? EPSKs are a really underspecified use case that I don't know how to evaluate it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've tweaked the text slightly and left the above questions as-is for now. Is the new text clearer? / Thoughts on the above?",

Rephrased a bit.\r\n\r\n> You also want to add a condition here that if the server provides retry keys that the client cannot use, then it can regard ESNI as securely disabled.\r\n\r\nAlready there:\r\n\r\n>  The client then processes the \"retry_keys\" field from the server's\r\n>  \"encrypted_server_name\" extension.

That's not a policy I would support.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, when you say \"clear\", do you mean \"cleartext and not secured\" or do you mean \"unambiguous, including verifying the public name\"?

(GitHub's UI is... not the best).\r\n\r\n> \"If none of the values provided in \"retry_keys\" contains a version supported by the client, the client MUST consider the server to have disabled ESNI.\"\r\n\r\nI tweaked the wording a bit based on the first part. It seemed better to adjust the surrounding text too. Re the second part, I'm not sure what \"[MUST consider](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919#section-2)\" would mean as a normative requirement...\r\n\r\n> What the client does in response to an authenticated signal that disables ESNI is a matter for client policy, so the SHOULD is inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe text around unechoed extensions also uses SHOULD. It's true that there isn't a single \"hook point\" for client policy around the disabling bit. It sounds like you might prefer a more \"abstracted\" text where something first outputs \"secure disable\", or \"secure replace\" and then there's policy on that.\r\n\r\nI haven't done that yet, in part because it's late on a Friday, but also I think we're well into wordsmithing weeds now. :-) I don't know what the right document organization would be for that. Also it's getting pretty long. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n> BTW, this would argue for having a third option: esni_disabled.\r\n\r\nIt's already there by way of not echoing the extension. I think a separate explicit version would only make sense if there are clients who:\r\n* are happy with `esni_retry_requested`\r\n* would be happy with `esni_disabled`\r\n* are *not* happy with the unechoed signal.\r\n\r\nThat preference is not entirely implausible because not echoing the extension is an implicit signal repurposing existing server behavior. However, that's also kind of the point, since it allows safe rollback. If server deployments cannot rely on that, the cost of deploying ESNI goes up dramatically.\r\n\r\nESNI, even more so than most TLS improvements, really wants a wide deployment, so I think it's good for the document to have a strong opinion here.\r\n\r\n(Specialized clients and specialized servers, of course, would probably ignore disable signals, but they would ignore `esni_disabled` too, so that's more about the SHOULD. But it seems to me that's covered by \"there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course\".)",

Add a mandatory extension carrying a \"host pointer,\" which is a (probably poorly named) struct containing a \"terminal CNAME\" for the domain, along with address masks, which may be partial or complete. Clients may use complete addresses if present, else they may use masks to resolve ESNI+A/AAAA mismatches. When these fail, the terminal CNAME may be used to get an address of some host that has the corresponding ESNI key.\r\n3. Add text describing how clients ought to resolve ESNI and A/AAAA records, and use the results to initiate TLS connections.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly more complex than #136.",

I'd be concerned that omission of a digest might lead to availability concerns.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have had `record_digest` is because the TLS handshake used to always hard-fail when client uses a corrupt ESNI record. With #124 being merged, we have a fallback mechanism that would work in _some_ failure modes without the need for the digest. However, I believe that there are still certain cases of hard failure (like the server sending an `illegal_parameter` alert) when the ESNI record is corrupt.\r\n\r\nPS. Therefore I think I might favor the approach proposed by @davidben in #150: place the IP address list outside of the ESNIKeys.",

Take for example the case of a server that has published only one key: trial decryption then is no more expensive that decryption directed by a specific checksum, which the adversary can learn from the DNS record. So an obvious mitigation in case of stress is to only trial one of the published keys, possibly the latest, or a randomly chosen one.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should point out the directed DOS attack -- for example, an adversary could bomb a forwarding server with repeated connection request. But then, that's not much more potent than repeated non-ESNI connection requests.",

The reasons are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of the proposed change is that it frees client from buffering the content of the ESNI extension (after encryption), when using a building block that does not support reusing the same public key pair. Though, we might argue that even with this change, clients might still want to buffer the extension for possible retransmission rather than doing another public key operation in case of receiving a HRR.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the proposed change is that it might require the server to do another public key operation when verifying the ESNI extension found in ClientHello being sent in response to HelloRetryRequest. Current design, by requiring the keys to be identical, allows a server to validate the indifference of the ESNI extension without actually deciphering the payload.\r\n\r\nOne of the role of HRR is to mitigate attacks. When under attack, I believe that servers would be reluctant to do an additional public key operation. Therefore, to me it seems that the proposed change would incentivize the server to skip the verification of the ESNI extension sent in response to HRR.\r\n\r\nComparing the benefit and the downside, my weak preference goes to retaining the design as-is, because as I stated, I think that clients would be (mostly) fine with the design, and under the assumption that it is beneficial to encourage servers to validate the ESNI extension sent in response to HRR.",

Therefore, when sending the first ClientHello, a client can just keep the encrypted payload of ESNI extension. Then, when it receives a HelloRetryRequest, it would retransmit the buffered payload of the ESNI extension.",

          "body": "(This comment ended up long, so I'm splitting it into sections.)\r\n\r\n**Why check the second ClientHello**\r\n\r\n> If we think that such check can be avoided (even though we would not encourage that), I think I'd be fine with allowing the client to change the public key.\r\n\r\nIf the server does not check the second ClientHello, then cut-and-paste attacks are possible against client/server pairs which hit HelloRetryRequest because we lose the binding between ESNI and the key shares that were actually used. (It really would be cleaner if we just stuffed something into the key schedule, but then the client needs to trial-decrypt or we need a cleartext \"yes, I used ESNI\" signal.)\r\n\r\nFor completeness, deployments which allow different services to have different version, cipher, or group preferences need to process ESNI on the first ClientHello because resolving HRR requires those preferences. Of course, services with different preferences will partition the anonymity sets a little bit, but enough deployments expect to be able to vary TLS parameters this way that I think we need to allow for this. (BoringSSL, for instance, resolves SNI on the first ClientHello.)\r\n\r\n**Split mode**\r\n\r\nOn that note, split mode and HRR are a little messy. Possibilities I can see:\r\n\r\n1. Dispatch happens at second ClientHello. Frontend and backend must agree on HRR-sensitive parameters, and backend gets a handshake transcript from the frontend.\r\n2. Dispatch happens at first ClientHello, but frontend and backend agree on enough of TLS parameters that frontend can sniff HelloRetryRequest + second ClientHello (technically a [protocol invariant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-9.3) violation) to check the ESNI.\r\n3. Backend and frontend both have ESNI keys. This contradicts #169.\r\n\r\n**Near-attack**\r\n\r\nFinally, I think there's one more issue here with changing the key share which, while not fatal, is rather a headache. Suppose we went with this PR. Here is a near-attack:\r\n\r\n1. Attacker observes an ESNI-ful HRR-ful connection. Let CH1 and CH2 be the first and second ClientHellos.\r\n2. Attacker wants to determine if CH1/CH2's ESNI contained hostname H. (It can repeat this process with different guesses.)\r\n3. Attacker makes a connection to the server. It replays CH1 and gets an HRR.\r\n4. Attacker sends its own second ClientHello with its own key shares and an ESNI record containing H.\r\n5. If H matched CH1's ESNI, the server will accept the connection and continue. If it mismatched, the server will fail with an alert.\r\n\r\nThis is only a near-attack because ClientESNIInner contains a nonce the attacker cannot guess, so even if it matched the hostname, it cannot match the nonce. But this means the server must perform the comparison in constant-time (attacker can repeat steps 3-5 all it wants) and the nonce is even more load-bearing in a subtle way.\r\n\r\nExample of subtlety: In both \"server must check CH2\" PRs, it is easy for the server to ignore it and no one notices. One could imagine saying the ESNI nonce must change in CH2, so the server *at least* doesn't ignore it. But that would turn this near-attack into an actual attack. Whereas I believe the same-key version avoids all of this.\r\n\r\n**Changing the key schedule**\r\n\r\nIt seems we're in this mess because we've bound ESNI to the handshake in a roundabout way rather than injecting the key into the key schedule. I believe this originally was to aid split mode, but we've since added this nonce anyway, so having frontend pass the key schedule addition into the backend is plausible. Perhaps this is worth reconsidering? Some thoughts:\r\n\r\nFirst, there isn't a slot in the key schedule for this. I think that's fine though, as long as we change the label. Here's one possibility:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             0\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n   PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret\r\n             |\r\n             +-----> Derive-Secret(...)\r\n             |                     = binder_key\r\n             |                     = client_early_traffic_secret\r\n             |                     = early_exporter_master_secret\r\n             v\r\n       Derive-Secret(., \"derived\", \"\")\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n   (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n       Derive-Secret(., \"esni nonce\", \"\")\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\nESNI nonce -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret\r\n             |\r\n             +-----> Derive-Secret(...)\r\n             |                     = client_handshake_traffic_secret\r\n             |                     = server_handshake_traffic_secret\r\n             v\r\n            ...\r\n ```\r\n(Arguably all the \"derived\" labels should have had names.)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is how to signal it on the client. I see two options:\r\n\r\n1. Cleartext signal in ServerHello. This violates \"do not stick out\" and makes the GREASE extensions totally useless.\r\n2. The client computes both server_handshake_traffic_secret values and trial-decrypts to figure out which one to use. This is trial decryption and non-destructive trial-decryption at that, so it's rather a headache. (On the plus side, it only needs to be done on the first handshake record.)\r\n\r\nNeither of these is very satisfactory but, then again, nor are our other two options. :-/\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nEverything is a mess.",

The server certificate needs to be padded regardless, so the server already needs to make decisions based on the length distributions of known hostnames.\r\n\r\nSecond, it dramatically increases the complexity of deploying ESNI. In the existing design, the actual certificate lookup on the server is relatively unchanged. The TLS library could even abstract much of the name lookup, public name fallback, etc., from the application by simply passing the name along the same interface as before and leave that portion unchanged. This design forces the server to have a new digest-based path, which extends throughout the entire configuration pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe `label_limit` notion for dealing with wildcards is also another source of stateful deployment problems with configuration mismatches. Perhaps I used to use a wildcard cert, but now I'd like to switch to individual subdomains. This transition is difficult under this PR. For more fun, the folks managing the names may be different from the folks who implemented ESNI, so the deployment concern will go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe wildcard cert scheme is also messy with protocols that do not have their own in-band vhosting mechanism and just use TLS. HTTP doesn't care about HTTP has a Host header, so it doesn't actually care about the SNI. (I will observe, however, that the Host header should probably trigger padding too, so we're still back to square one. :-) )",

The purpose of \"SHOULD ignore\" is to ensure that DNS-based load balancing of A/AAAA on SvcDomainName continues to work correctly.  Whether the client uses an ipv6hint or a AAAA record for SvcDomainName, it will be contacting a server that has the corresponding ESNI private key; there's no possibility of mismatch either way.\r\n\r\n> perhaps we can clarify this in the HTTPSVC draft?\r\n\r\nI think the confusion here is that in HTTPSSVC, clients use the IP of SvcDomainName, not the IP of the origin hostname.  There's no way for a client to accidentally combine the ESNIConfig for the SvcDomainName with the IP of the origin hostname (or of a different SvcDomainName).\r\n\r\nI think the draft is pretty clear on this point (e.g. the [intro example](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc-00#section-1.1)), but the authors always think that :).

All of their traffic is going to a single  CDN IP.\r\n\r\nThe point of the second resolution is to move customer traffic onto the CDN's preferred IP.\r\n\r\n> Once I have connected to the server, it can Alt-Svc me itself.\r\n\r\nTrue, but HTTPSSVC doesn't require clients to support Alt-Svc.  (Chrome, for example, does not support this feature of Alt-Svc.)\r\n\r\n> Say I resolve example.com and get 1.2.3.4 for ipv4 hints. Now I am supposed to in parallel connect to the server and try to resolve SvcDomainName? But what then? I've already started the connection so I'm not going to abort it if I get a 5.6.7.8....\r\n\r\nThe draft says clients \"SHOULD switch to an IP address in those records as soon as possible\".  An aggressive implementation might start connecting to 5.6.7.8, and close the connection to 1.2.3.4 once it is connected.  (This is roughly what Chrome does for QUIC upgrade.)  A less aggressive implementation might just let the A record sit in the local DNS cache, so that any subsequent connections to this origin can go to the CDN's preferred IP.",

I believe [one of our experiments](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/04/11/pqconftls.html) suggested the additional cost is roughly linear to the number of bytes.\r\n\r\nWe could encrypt some sort of \"delta ClientHello\", either saying \"copy these extensions from the outside\" or something hilarious scheme where you specify a sequence of new bytes and references into your outer ClientHello... (I think the former is easier to send while the latter is easier to receive.)\r\n\r\nAnother thought, though it requires a side channel from frontend to backend, is the `ClientHelloInner` omits `key_shares` in favor of a new `key_shares_hashed` extension where you insert `SHA256(ClientHelloOuter.key_shares)` for transcript purposes. The receiver then asserts the hash matches and pretends you included `ClientHelloOuter.key_shares` in `ClientHelloInner` for handshake purposes.",

The rationale here would be that the only purpose of ClientHelloOuter is to enable the fallback handshake, and so those keys are just protecting the SNI (and ESNIConfig, but that's just there to protect SNI), and we could potentially live with that being non-quantum-safe, especially if we're not going to use PQ algorithms for ESNI encryption. And of course if we *do* use PQ algorithms for ESNI encryption, then the overhead of the second CH is only about 1/2 as opposed to double.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "@martinthomson Yeah, compression was what I was referring with \"delta ClientHello\". You could imagine a ClientHello-specific compression that knows how to toss extensions around (in which case, yeah, it starts getting closer to ESNI transformation), or some more generic delta encoding. Here's an ad hoc goofy thing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum { bytes(0), reference(1) } FragmentType;\r\n \r\nstruct {\r\n  uint24 offset;\r\n  uint24 length;\r\n} ReferenceFragment;\r\n \r\nopaque BytesFragment<1..2^24-1>;\r\n \r\nstruct {\r\n  FragmentType type;\r\n  select (Fragment.type) {\r\n    // Append these bytes.\r\n    case bytes: BytesFragment;\r\n    // Append the referenced fragment of the outer ClientHello.\r\n    case reference: ReferenceFragment;\r\n  }\r\n} Fragment;\r\n \r\nstruct {\r\n  // Included so preallocating the buffer and enforcing size limits is easy.\r\n  uint24 clienthello_length;\r\n  // Walk over all the fragments to reconstruct the ClientHello.\r\n  Fragment clienthello_fragments<0..2^24-1>;\r\n} ESNIPlaintext;\r\n```\r\n\r\nA ClientHello-specific encoding is easier to produce since senders know how their ClientHellos look like and we can tailor things what fields should and shouldn't be copied. But it's harder to decode since you need to add checks for silly questions like \"what order do I insert extensions?\" or \"what happens if the placeholder is missing\" or \"what happens if there are two placeholders?\" or \"what happens if the outer ClientHello is missing the extension to copy?\".\r\n\r\nConversely, though it may take more spec text to describe, a bytes-based encoding is easier to decode since you just blindly evaluate the two opcodes and only need to include a couple of checks. But it's harder to encode since you need to account for length prefixes when chopping things up.",

If interested here's the [diff](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/compare/master...sftcd:encch) and [some notes](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/encch/esnistuff/echo.md) on what I did.\r\n\r\nDoing that was fairly messy but not that hard, the main thoughts/questions I was left with were:\r\n- <strike>it'd maybe be easier to have the ESNI-specific padding in the esni-nonce extension directly as that'd mean less change to OpenSSL API behaviour (applications can set callbacks to do padding themselves too)</strike> In the end, I added a CH padding extension to the inner CH, (sort of) as envisaged in the PR, but could as easily do the padding within the esni_nonce. Still not sure if there're any API issues. The ``padded_length`` field in the ESNIConfig is now (IMO) even more of a bad plan than before as the relevant thing to pad is the entire plaintext inner CH and not just the server_name - so whomever is writing values to the DNS has even less likelihood of knowing a good exact max/value. (And it can be >260 now too.)\r\n - I took a stab at using my OpenSSL code for [HPKE](https://github.com/sftcd/happykey) instead of the ESNI-specific stuff that's been in earlier drafts and that wasn't a problem (though I didn't spend time thinking about how exactly to use HPKE - I just set the TLS session key share as the AAD)\r\n- I'm still very unclear as to what rules should/must apply to the relationship between values in the inner and outer CH's - but the simpler we can make that the better (I don't mean compression here, just what rules are to apply when we have two versions of a thing, like the TLS session key share or ALPN for example)\r\n- For ALPN, I implemented support for different values in inner and outer CH, which was easy enough and could even be possibly useful:-) One upshot of that is that it more or less means that the server really ought also do record layer padding of the EncryptedExtensions as otherwise the length of that might give the game away where values like ALPN differ between inner and outer CH.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case: I didn't try any compression and this code is likely flakey as hell in error cases, so don't anyone go using it for anything:-) I plan to ditch it anyway once draft-06 is out.",

      "body": "[This PR sits on top of #198. Ignore the first commit to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe currently have two levels of mechanisms for servers to advertise multiple sets of parameters. First, each ESNIConfig has multiple keys in it, so a server can suport multiple groups at once. These keys are stapled together so a single HTTPSSVC record, etc., delivers the entire configuration.\r\n\r\nAt a layer above that, we have a version/extension-based mechanism. The server may advertise multiple ESNIConfigs to cover multiple versions of ESNI (hopefully we won't need this mechanism after standardization, but it's quite useful for draft versions) or multiple sets of mandatory extensions. Unlike the group advertisement, these are each in separate configuration units, so, e.g., they may be in multiple HTTPSSVC records.\r\n\r\nThis PR flattens the two mechanisms into one. Each ESNIConfig now has a single KeyShareEntry. Multiple groups and multiple versions are expressed in the same way: multiple ESNIConfig structures. It then introduces a wrapper ESNIConfigs structure which is the new unit of ESNI configuration delivered in HTTPSSVC, etc.\r\n\r\nThis should be paired with a change to draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc to carry an ESNIConfigs, not an ESNIConfig (formerly ESNIKeys). (@bemasc FYI)\r\n\r\nThis fixes a number of oddities:\r\n\r\n- Client and server need to maintain two levels of configuration. On the server, the structure has two layers of lists, something like list(tuple(ESNIConfig, list(PrivateKey))). Now the server maintains list(tuple(ESNIConfig, PrivateKey)). Conversely, the client needed two negotiation loops whereas now it only requires one.\r\n\r\n- Logic across different layers of the client stack now more reliably have the full ESNI configuration available in one unit.\r\n\r\n  In the old design, a single ESNIConfig, rather than a set of them, would be correlated with an IP address or CNAME, by way of the HTTPSSVC record. A server which supportsed multiple ESNI versions or mandatory extension sets would advertise several HTTPSSVC records, potentially with different IPs. That means the DNS and transport connection logic must know about TLS capabitilies to pick the right HTTPSSVC record.\r\n\r\n  In the new design, the server includes all its variations at once, so the DNS and transport logic can reasonably pick an HTTPSSVC purely based on whether the TLS stack supports ESNI, rather than the full set of capabilities. That is, the text in [0] does not work right now, and this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, in the likely case that the server only supports one version and one set of extensions, the non-key ESNI config bits (notably the public name; the rest is small) are repeated for every named group. However, the public name should not be that large and servers should only need one or two groups[1].\r\n\r\nThis also does make ESNIConfigs and ESNIConfig separate structures, which is slightly goofy.

But ISTM for many scenarios the entity that\ngenerates the ECHOConfig won't know the distribution\nof names in use (e.g. whoever configures OpenSSL won't,\nsame with Apache etc.) so it's likely they'll have to\ngo for whatever is the max (i.e. 254).

Some will not. Many (most?) server\nECHOConfig instances will make use of default settings.\nThose'll pick 254 because adding a new VirtualHost to\nan apache instance (or similar) won't be co-ordinated\nwith making a new ECHOConfig in general.

I don't follow how this PR helps in that regard. It seems they still need to come up with a random value or a default, but now it's even less clear how to set it well.\r\n\r\n>> I think it thus makes sense to target a different\r\n>> maximum here.\r\n>\r\n> Then it can't be the max:-) The 254 value matches the\r\n> max for server_name IIRC.\r\n\r\nEr, yes, sorry I meant to say target a different public length. That is, 254 is so far from the maximum domain name in practice (As it should be! Hard length limits ought to be comfortably away from the actual requirement.), so padding up to it is wasteful. I think it would be better to pad up to a tighter value and, if we exceed it, accept that we only have the fallback multiple of 16 padding. (Or maybe a different strategy.) It does result in smaller anonymity sets in edge cases, but I think that a reasonable default tradeoff given other desires like broader deployment and not wasting too much of users' data.\r\n\r\n> Ok.

For each field, determine how much it makes sense to pad given what kinds of things it sends. If it varies ALPN, maybe round up to the largest of those. Most of this can be determined without server help.\r\n2. For fields where server help is useful, like the name, apply that help. Right now it's simply a `max` function. I'm also open to other strategies.\r\n3. Sum all that padding together.\r\n4. In order to generally reduce entropy across different kinds of clients, maybe apply some additional overall padding, like rounding up to a multiple of 16, which cuts down the state space by 16x and doesn't cost much. (Or maybe we should round up to the nearest `int(64 * 1.1**i)`? That avoids higher resolution on longer values while bounding the fraction of bytes wasted by this step.) That said, it's worth keeping in mind that clients already vary quite a bit in the cleartext portions of the ClientHello. There's a bit of tension between wanting to look like the other clients and wanting to ship new security improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is different from this PR because this PR asks the server to report a value including things it doesn't know anything about (how large the client-controlled parameters are). I don't quite follow (c). It seems this PR and the above proposal has roughly the same failure modes when something is too long. The difference is that `maximum_name_length`'s failure mode is only tripped on particular long names (something the server knows the distribution of), while this PR's equivalent failure mode is based on factors outside the server control, yet the server is responsible for the value.",

The question is whether per-packet costs dominate or per-byte costs do, and whether the experiment sometimes increased the number of packets (e.g. by sometimes bumping the ultimate ClientHello size above 1280). See Section 5.1 in https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final186.pdf for device performance metrics on bytes vs packets.\r\n\r\nLooking at the ClientHello traffic on my computer, I can see that Safari is sending ClientHello messages that are about 500-600 bytes. My copy of Chrome seems to be sending CurveCECPQ2 (16696?) shares, and its ClientHello messages are fragmented.",

For instance, a client that sends two key shares will have very different padding requirements to one that sends only one.  For that to work, we need to assume that implementation-/deployment-specific variation of the inner CH is largely eliminated as a result of the compression scheme we adopt.  That also assumes that these variations in client behaviour are not privacy-sensitive.  \r\n\r\nI think that we should be directly acknowledging those assumptions if that is indeed the case.\r\n\r\nIf there is a significant variation in size due to client-specific measures, then we're in a bit of an awkward position.  That might render any similarly simple scheme ineffective.  For instance, a client that later supports a set of ALPN identifiers that could vary in length depending on context cannot use this signal directly. It has to apply its own logic about the padding of that extension.  That a client is doing this won't be known to a server that deploys this today. In that case, the advice from the server (which knows most about the anonymity set across which it is hoping to spread the resulting CH), isn't going to be forced through an additional filter at the client.  The results are unlikely to be good without a great deal of care.",

Restricting them to come only from the ECHOConfig seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI think the key observation in this PR is that the outer ClientHello isn't _really_ offering to establish a TLS connection -- it's a not-crazy-looking wrapper for the actual ClientHello inside the ECHO extension, and the vehicle for the recovery flow.  The only things a server can legitimately do are respond to the inner ClientHello or do a recovery handshake.  Thus, most of the things you might set on the outer ClientHello are irrelevant; they can be chosen to look innocuous, chosen at random, or copied from the inner ClientHello as the implementation chooses.",
